## Text Extraction from PDF for Ebook Digitization

The first bot in my collection, named `text_extraction_pipeline.py`, is specifically designed to automate the complex process of extracting text from PDF documents, a common challenge in the digitization of ebooks. Utilizing a Dagster pipeline, this bot efficiently manages a sequence of data transformations, each crucial for streamlining the digitization process.

For those interested in exploring the code and contributing, all resources and project details are available on my GitHub repository. You can delve into the codebase, experiment with the implementations, or even contribute to its development.

**Workflow Breakdown:**
1. **PDF Splitting:** The process begins by splitting a single PDF document into individual pages. This simplifies the handling of content by breaking down a potentially large document into manageable parts.
   
2. **Image Conversion:** Each page is then converted into an image. This transformation is essential for the subsequent optical character recognition (OCR) as OCR technology typically operates on image data.

3. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** OCR is applied to each image to meticulously extract written content. This step is the core of the bot's functionality, translating visual data back into editable and searchable text.

4. **Data Persistence:** The extracted text is finally persisted into a database. Depending on the setup, this can be stored in DuckDB for lightweight, serverless scenarios or Elasticsearch for projects requiring scalable, searchable text storage.

> If any step in the process fails, Dagster allows for rerunning just that specific step without needing to restart the entire process from scratch. This capability is especially beneficial in handling large volumes of data, as it prevents the loss of progress made in preceding steps, thereby saving time and computational resources.
